# Purpose

This package is intended to ease reliability analysis using the Weibull distribution, which is the most common method of reliability analysis.  Check out the [documentation](http://weibull.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for more information!

<span style="color:red">This project has been superceded by a better library called [reliability](https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  Please head over there and show the author some love!</span>

# Project Maturity

The functionality implemented herein is accurate to the best of my ability, but you should head on over to [reliability](https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more feature-rich and better-maintained project.

<span style="color:red">
This project will not have future revision and you should refactor your code accordingly.  I have included an import warning in `v0.1.3`.

# Contributions

As this library is being depreciated and superceded by the community, I will happily recommend that you direct your efforts towards the [reliability](https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.  Thank you!

If you have created a feature branch and made your changes there, your pull request is much more likely to be accepted even if it doesn't have `pytest`, examples, and documentation.  If you have made the changes on the `master` branch, then it is expected to be a comprehensive pull request with testing, examples, and working documentation.

Initial work on this repository was done by user [tgray](https://github.com/tgray).  You can still peruse the [original repository](https://github.com/tgray/weibull).
